Hey folks, I'm MysticVeil a Senior in a Geology Program @ Undisclosed University!
IF you want to know more about me I enjoy Music, Games, Studying, & Coding!
I currently code in Python and MatLab however I will start my C++ Journey soon; so wish me luck!

My Current project is looking making a statistical model that can look at any given CSV file with various graphs using the following libs: 
- Pandas, Statsmodels.api, & SeaBorn

I Currently have a few project on my mind!
- Creating a password vault with biometric encyption & possible adding the fuction for a USB key lock as well to the file... if I ever get time to do so.
- Simulating wave propagation in rock material from a explosive blast... I just started to learn and study PDE's so this may take a hot minute to get to.
- Anything related to Geological Computation, Geophysics, Blasting, or Cryptography related really is in my to-do-list.
I'm currently looking at Grad School to Study Blasting optimization in rock material, I like explosives... Don't Judge!
